{"name":"Webgrind","tagline":"Xdebug Profiling Web Frontend in PHP","body":"## Webgrind\r\n-----------\r\nWebgrind is a [Xdebug](http://www.xdebug.org) profiling web frontend in PHP5. It implements a subset of the features of [kcachegrind](http://kcachegrind.sourceforge.net/html/Home.html) and installs in seconds and works on all platforms. For quick'n'dirty optimizations it does the job.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that a larger number of kcachegrind features will be implemented in the future, bringing webgrind closer to completing one of the [suggested PHP Google Summer of Code 2008](http://wiki.php.net/gsoc/2008#xdebug_profiling_web_frontend). At this point nothing has been planned, though.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n------------\r\n  * Super simple, cross platform installation - obviously :)\r\n  * Track time spent in functions by self cost or inclusive cost. Inclusive cost is time inside function + calls to other functions.\r\n  * See if time is spent in internal or user functions.\r\n  * See where any function was called from and which functions it calls.\r\n  * Generate a call graph using [gprof2dot.py](https://github.com/jrfonseca/gprof2dot)\r\n\r\nSuggestions for improvements and new features are more than welcome - this is just a start.\r\n\r\nMailing list is available through the [webgrind google group](http://groups.google.com/group/webgrind-general/topics).\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n----------------\r\n  1. Download webgrind\r\n  2. Unzip package to favourite path accessible by webserver\r\n  3. Load webgrind in browser and start profiling\r\n  4. (Optional) under linux, run `make` in the unzipped folder to enable faster preprocessing\r\n\r\nSee the [Installation Wiki page](https://github.com/jokkedk/webgrind/wiki/Installation) for more.\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n-----------\r\nWebgrind is written by [Joakim Nyg√•rd](http://jokke.dk) and [Jacob Oettinger](http://oettinger.dk). It would not have been possible without the great tool that Xdebug is thanks to [Derick Rethans](http://www.derickrethans.nl).\r\n\r\nThis project is a development fork of the [stalled upstream](https://github.com/jokkedk/webgrind).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
